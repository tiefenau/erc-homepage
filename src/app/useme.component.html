      <h2 class="featurette-heading">Frontiers of Usable Security<br/><span class="text-muted"> (2015-2021)</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Usability problems are a major cause of many of today’s IT-security incidents. Security systems are often too complicated, time-consuming, and error prone. For more than a decade researchers in the domain of usable security (USEC) have attempted to combat these problems by conducting interdisciplinary research focusing on the root causes of the problems and on the creation of usable security mechanisms. While major improvements have been made, to date USEC research has focused almost entirely on the non-expert end-user. However, many of the most catastrophic security incidents were not caused by end-users, but by developers or administrators. Heartbleed and Shellshock were both caused by single developers yet had global consequences. The Sony hack in 2014 compromised an entire multi-national IT-infrastructure and misappropriated over 100 TB of data, unnoticed. Fundamentally, every software vulnerability and misconfigured system is caused by developers or administrators making mistakes, but very little research has been done into the underlying causalities and possible mitigation strategies. Thus end-users are only the tip of the iceberg in USEC research.
The ERC USECFrontiers project aims to extend the frontiers of usable security by conducting foundational research into USEC methods for developers and administrators. To this end we will research and systemize the hitherto unexamined human factors in a carefully selected set of problems currently faced by developers and administrators. Our aim is to extract and develop principles, methods, and best practices for conducting usability studies and research with these actors and establish a foundation for this emerging research field.

    <div class="col-md-12 order-md-2" style="margin-top:30px;">
      <p class="lead">To establish a solid foundation for this new research field and fulfil the primary objective of this project, we will conduct research into the methodological differences between USEC research for administrators and developers and non-expert end-users, with the aim of creating a set of principles, methods and best practices for this research domain. We aim to achieve this by combining methodological research with studies, re-examining prominent application areas from USEC research from the perspective of administrators and developers. Each study will be conducted on two levels – the primary level and the meta-level. The primary/direct level will examine application specific independent variables: For instance how does a change in the API design affect the ability of developers to create secure software? The meta-level will be used for the methods research and examine and compare different design choices that can be made when designing experiments: laboratory as opposed to online or field studies; students as opposed to administrator and developers, longitudinal studies as opposed to first contact studies; the number of conditions and number of participants; task sizes; deception; training; and payment/incentivization. These design attributes will be treated as independent variables and the application studies will be conducted under a variety of configurations. The results and the experience gathered in these application studies will be correlated and methodological lessons-learnt will be extracted and systematized to form a solid foundation for USEC research for administrators and developers. </p>
